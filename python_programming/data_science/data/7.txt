Using open source intelligence OSINT techniques and tools it is possible to map an organizations Internet facing networks and services without actually sending any packets or just a few standard requests to the target network Open source intelligence OSINT is defined as deriving intelligence from publicly available resources Looking at this another way an attacker can do a comprehensive analysis and mapping of your network infrastructure and technologies without actually sending you any packets and therefore without you having any knowledge that this reconnaissance has taken place Consider the following graphic you will notice that as the analysis is progressed newly discovered items IP address host names net blocks can open up new areas to explore and attack Identifying all known hosts for an organization allows us to continue to dig deeper for more systems and hosts to target By examining all discovered IP address blocks ASN we can find other hosts within the net block of interest Identifying related domains will lead to the discovery of more hosts Think of a single web server the actual open services ssh http rdp are all points of attack discovering all the virtual hosts running on the server is also important as web applications running on any of the virtual hosts are also an attack vector In this overview the focus is the gathering of information specifically related to the organizations network footprint and services Open source intelligence from social networks email addresses search engines and document meta data is often used for the purpose of developing a social engineering attack Basic DNS queries
Most domains will have a web site mail server and dns servers associated with it These will be our initial point of reference when discovering the attack surface We can use DNS lookup tools and whois to find where the web A records mail MX records and DNS NS records services are being hosted hackertarget com IN	A hackertarget com IN	AAAA	a e fc ff fe d hackertarget com IN	MX aspmx l google com hackertarget com IN	MX alt aspmx l google com hackertarget com IN	MX alt aspmx l google com hackertarget com IN	MX aspmx googlemail com hackertarget com IN	NS	ns domaincontrol com hackertarget com IN	NS	ns domaincontrol com Initial Host discovery Google Bing and Netcraft
A simple search for all host names related to the target domain is also a good starting point Using search engines such as Google site example com and Bing site example com can reveal sub domains and web hosts that may be of interest When searching with Google if there are a large number of results you can remove the known domains with the following query site example com site www example com
Google Hacking is a well documented technique that involves getting Google to reveal technical information that is of interest to an attacker The Google hacking database is the best place to get started if you are not familiar with this technique Another handy tool is the netcraft host search Enter the domain as your search term be sure to include the before your domain name to only get sub domains of your target domain You can see the Netcraft search provides a quick overview of known web hosts for the domain and the net blocks that they are hosted in Another interesting piece of information is the historical data Netcraft have been collecting this data for a long time Finding more hosts through data mining DNS records
Passive DNS reconnaissance allows discovery of DNS host records without actively querying the target DNS servers If DNS monitoring is in place active dns recon could be detected by the target Techniques that can be classed as active DNS recon include brute forcing common sub domains of the target or attempting DNS zone transfers query type AXFR There are many on line resources for passive DNS analysis and searching rather than sticking to regular DNS lookups we can perform large scale searches using DNS data sets One such resource is that provided by scans io the scans io data
Scans io and Project Sonar gather Internet wide scan data and make it available to researchers and the security community This data includes port scans and a dump of all the DNS records that they can find Using the DNS records dump you can search through over GB of DNS data for all entries that match your target domain If you do not wish to go through the trouble of downloading and extracting such a large chunk of data you can use our free tools to get started with your network reconnaissance Name Servers type NS
The location of the DNS servers may be internal to the organization network or as is often the case they be a hosted service This can be often be determined by simply looking up the net block owner ASN of the IP address of the DNS server When looking at DNS servers we can not only review the Host A records that point to the IP address of the DNS server but also do a reverse search across DNS data for all hosts that use the same DNS server In a hosted situation this may not be as valuable but if its an internal company DNS server we will quickly identify all related domains for the organization that are at least using this DNS infrastructure targetdomain com targetdomain co uk targetdomain net forgotten footy tipping site with no security controls com vpn targetdomain com webmail targetdomain com
SPF Records type TXT
Sender Policy Framework is configured through the TXT DNS record If configured this will contain all servers or networks that are allowed to send email from the domain This can often reveal IP addresses and net blocks of the organization that you may not have been aware of hackertarget com IN	TXT v spf include spf google com ip ip ip ip ip a e fc ff fe d ip c fc ff fee d include spf google com all Reverse DNS across IP blocks of Interest
Once you have a list of all IP addresses and ASN s of interest you can attempt to find more active hosts within those net blocks that the organizations owns or has assets within A good way of finding more hosts is to perform a reverse DNS search across the full net blocks of interest x host example com x targetdomain com x forgotten unpatched dev host targetdomain com x host example com
Finding Web Servers
When it comes to mapping a network the web servers of an organization open up a wide attack surface They also contain a wealth of information not just published but insights into the technologies in use operating systems and even how well managed the information technology resources of the organization are To map the attack surface of a web server it is important to consider the available network services the virtual hosts websites and the web applications in use Identifying all virtual web hosts on the web server is an important part of the information gathering process Different web sites on the same web server will often be managed using different content management systems and web applications A vulnerability in any of these web applications could allow code execution on the web server To identify the virtual web hosts on a particular IP Address there are a number of well known web based tools such as Bing and Robtex An IP address search using the ip search term on the Bing search engine will reveal all web sites that Bing has in its index that point to that same IP address Experience shows this is a good starting place but like the Bing search engine in general can contain stale entries and limited results As previously mentioned scans io regularly compiles all the DNS data it can publicly find we can use this data to identify the web server hosts A records By searching for an IP address in all the known DNS records we can find all the hosts that resolve to that IP This is the method we use for the Reverse IP Address Search tool we created and also parts of the dnsdumpster com project Other Network Services
In any vulnerability assessment it is essential to identify all listening services A web server will of course usually have a web server port an ftp server will have an FTP service port and a mail server will be listening for mail smtp on pop on imap on and more It is important to discover all the listening services in order to determine if they are vulnerable to exploitation or authentication attacks Traditionally these services would be identified using Port Scans with tools such as the Nmap Port Scanner Of course using a port scanner is no longer a passive undertaking as using a tool such as Nmap involves sending packets to the target systems shodan io search engine
To passively find open services and the banners for the open services we can use the shodan io search engine From the banners of services such as web servers mail and ftp we are able to identify the version of the server software running the service and often the operating system of the server All without sending any packets to the target organization dnsdumspter com is a Free tool that automagically collates DNS and host data Becoming the attacker and the Next Steps
Putting yourself in the shoes of an attacker and attempting to map out an organizations Internet facing systems is a great way to develop an understanding of the attack surface of a network Start by finding all the public IP addresses of known hosts for a domain expand this to include net blocks of interest that are hosting these services Now try to find all virtual host names that are hosted on the IP addresses and from this you can map out the web applications in use From this initial passive analysis it may be possible to identify vulnerable or possibly vulnerable points in the network this can inform your next steps and where to focus your attack or vulnerability assessment Moving on from passive analysis the next steps to consider are active information gathering such as DNS zone transfers or sub domain brute forcing Followed by active network scanning such as Nmap Port Scans and vulnerability scanning Ultimately the next steps will be determined by your scope and purpose for the performing the analysis Share this Post dns tools ip tools osint recon tshark tutorial and filter examples Exploring the Hacker Tools of Mr Robot var disqus url https hackertarget com quietly mapping the network attack surface var disqus identifier http hackertarget com p var disqus container id disqus thread var disqus shortname hackertarget var disqus title Quietly Mapping the Network Attack Surface var disqus config custom window disqus config var disqus config function All currently supported events onReady fires when everything is ready onNewComment fires when a new comment is posted onIdentify fires when user is authenticated this language this callbacks onReady pushfunction sync comments in the background so we don t block the page var script document createElement script script async true script src cf action sync comments post id var firstScript document getElementsByTagName script firstScript parentNode insertBeforescript firstScript if disqus config custom disqus config custom callthis function var dsq document createElement script dsq type text javascript dsq async true dsq src disqus shortname disqus com embed js document getElementsByTagName head document getElementsByTagName body appendChilddsq HackerTarget com makes securing your systems easier with hosted open source vulnerability scanners Subscribe to the low volume list Security news site updates and more copy Hacker Target Pty Ltd ACN Terms of Use Privacy Policy Powered by Open Source Software functioni s o g r a m i GoogleAnalyticsObject r ir ir function ir q ir q pusharguments ir l new Date a s createElemento m s getElementsByTagNameo a async a src g m parentNode insertBeforea m window document script www google analytics com analytics js ga ga create UA auto ga send pageview
